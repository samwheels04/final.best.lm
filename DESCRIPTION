Description:
    best.lm is a function to create the best possible linear model with a
    specified number of predictor variables. It splits the data into a training
    and test set, and the sizes of the sets can be changed in the "train_size"
    parameter. Then it iterates through every possible linear model and finds the
    best one based on the adjusted R squared and mean squared error.
